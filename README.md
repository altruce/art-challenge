Create digital art with your creativity and knowledge

### Requirements
- Java
  - Verify with: java -version
- Gradle
  - Verify with: gradle -version
  - If not, you can install it the following ways:
    - If you use Mac and have Homebrew installed: brew install gradle
    - If you use Windows and have Chocolatey installed: choco install gradle
    - If you want to install gradle manually you may follow this installation guide: https://gradle.org/install/

### Setup
- Fork the repo and clone it to your local machine
- In the Main.java file, read the instructions and edit the functions accordingly

### Hints

- There is a checksum on the Canvas.java file. 
Do not edit this file! The automated test will detect it

- Your program will involve loops, so make sure they are not infinite.

- You may create your own classes or files, so long as the canvas stays unchanged

- The solution to the problem will take a while to compute, don't be afraid if it takes a minute.
However, it shouldn't take longer than a couple of minutes at most

- Make sure you don't have too many print statements! This can lag up your computer and freeze your IDE
